# Handwriting-Recognition

The model was trained in kaggle and weights were downloaded and saved at Resource folder.

To run the project:
1. Install all the libraries used in main.py, page_to_lines.py.
2. Install tensorflow version 1.14.0, Keras version 2.4.3
3. Edit the paths wherever required in main.py
4. Delete 'delete.txt' from temp and upload.
5. Run main.py

The original model was trained using the IAM Handwriting Dataset(lines), so for predicting an whole page the page_to_lines.py file was written.
Do not delete any folder even if it's empty.
